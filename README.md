# Sprint 7 project

## Descprition
Testing API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) with JavaScript
The hm07-qa-us project is designed to test various API endpoints provided by the Urban Grocers server.

The tests will verify response status codes and the contents of the response bodies.


### Technologies and Techniques Used
Testing API endpoints by using PostMan, VS Code, GitHub, GitBash, and JavaScript.
Used automation testing with JavaScript, Node, and Jest
Also use [apiDocs](https://cnt-f24c25eb-9569-46d6-9b0f-66da2515234c.containerhub.tripleten-services.com)

## How to Run the Tests
1. Clone the Repository
2. npm install in the terminal
3. Update the Configuration
4. Start the Server
 Use apiDoc: URL /docs/ to check the endpoints documentation.
5. Restart the Server (if needed)
6. Secure an API endpoint and make sure it is functional in PostMan
7. Update the endpoint in the test files and add JavaScript to the necessary lines to properly run the tests
8. Run the tests using npx jest
