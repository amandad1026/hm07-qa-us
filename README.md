## Descprition
Testing API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) with JavaScript
The hm07-qa-us project is designed to test various API endpoints provided by the Urban Grocers server. The project includes tasks to write tests for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to ensure the API's reliability and correctness. The tests will verify response status codes and the contents of the response bodies.


### Technologies and Techniques Used
Testing API endpoints by using PostMan, VS Code, GitHub, GitBash, and JavaScript.
Used automation testing with JavaScript, Node, and Jest
Also use [apiDocs](https://cnt-f24c25eb-9569-46d6-9b0f-66da2515234c.containerhub.tripleten-services.com)
